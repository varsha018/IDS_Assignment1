**Introduction to Data Science (S2-22_DSECLZG532)-ASSIGNMENT**

1. Business Understanding

Students are expected to identify an analytical problem of your choice. You have to detail the Business Understanding part of your problem under this heading which basically addresses the following questions.

1. What is the business problem that you are trying to solve?
2. What data do you need to answer the above problem?
3. What are the different sources of data?
4. What kind of analytics task are you performing?
 
2. Data Acquisition
"For the problem identified , find an appropriate data set (Your data set must be unique with minimum **20 features and 10k rows**) from any public data source.

2.1 Download the data directly

2.2 Code for converting the above downloaded data into a dataframe

2.3 Confirm the data has been correctly by displaying the first 5 and last 5 records.

2.4 Display the column headings, statistical information, description and statistical summary of the data.

2.5 Write your observations from the above.
1. Size of the dataset
2. What type of data attributes are there?
3. Is there any null data that has to be cleaned?

3. Data Preparation
"If input data is numerical or categorical, do 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4\n",
"If input data is text, do 3.3 and 3.4"

3.1 Check for:
duplicate data
missing data
data inconsistencies

3.2 Apply techiniques
to remove duplicate data
to impute or remove missing data
to remove data inconsistencies

3.3 Encode categorical data

3.4 Report
Mention and justify the method adopted
to remove duplicate data, if present
to impute or remove missing data, if present
to remove data inconsistencies, if present
OR for textdata
How many tokens after step 3?
how may tokens after stop words filtering?
If the any of the above are not present, then also add in the report below.

3.5 Identify the target variables.
Separate the data from the target such that the dataset is in the form of (X,y) or (Features, Label)
Discretize / Encode the target variable or perform one-hot encoding on the target or any other as and if required.
Report the observations

4. Data Exploration using various plots
4.1 Scatter plot of each quantitative attribute with the target.
4.2 EDA using visuals
Use (minimum) 2 plots (pair plot, heat map, correlation plot, regression plot...) to identify the optimal set of attributes that can be used for classification.
Name them, explain why you think they can be helpful in the task and perform the plot as well. Unless proper justification for the choice of plots given, no credit will be awarded.

5. Data Wrangling
5.1 Univariate Filters
Numerical and Categorical Data
Identify top 5 significant features by evaluating each feature independently with respect to the target/other variable by exploring
1. Mutual Information (Information Gain)\n",
2. Gini index
3. Gain Ratio
4. Chi-Squared test
5. Strenth of Association

5.2 Report observations
Write your observations from the results of each method. Clearly justify your choice of the method.
 
6. Implement Machine Learning Techniques
Use any 2 ML tasks
1. Classification
2. Clustering
3. Association Analysis
4. Anomaly detection
You may use algorithms included in the course, e.g. Decision Tree, K-means etc. or an algorithm you learnt on your own with a brief explanation.
A clear justification have to be given for why a certain algorithm was chosen to address your problem.

6.1 ML technique 1 + Justification"
6.2 ML technique 2 + Justification"

7. Conclusion
Compare the performance of the ML techniques used.
Derive values for preformance study metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score, AUC-ROC etc to compare the ML algos and plot them. A proper comparision based on different metrics should be done and not just accuracy alone, only then the comparision becomes authentic. You may use Confusion matrix, classification report, Word cloud etc as per the requirement of your application/problem.

8. Solution
What is the solution that is proposed to solve the business problem discussed in Section 1. Also share your learnings while working through solving the problem in terms of challenges, observations, decisions made etc.
